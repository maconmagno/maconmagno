### Hello there  ðŸŒ›


- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maconmagno, I am a PhD Physics student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m working with radio morphologies, spectral indices, feedback signatures, etc. of radio-quiet BAT AGN.
- ðŸŒ± Learning how to reduce radio images through CASA, along with reading more about AGN. ðŸŒ² (completed; except for the reading)
- ðŸŒ± I'm now focused on trying to understand the Fundamental Plane of Black Hole Activity, the Coronal Relation for Stars that seems to extend out to AGN, and modeling radio SEDS.
